## Description:

This problem and related data comes from a Kaggle competition "March Machine Learning Mania 2017", which aimed to predict the result of 2017 NCAA basketball tournament with historical data of NCAA basketball games since 1985. We will use historical data from 1985 to 2016 to build prediction models and use 2017 game results as our final test dataset to evaluate the performance of the models.

In the dataset we have indices of teams and seasons, lists of tourney seeds and tourney slots, and the game results and details of each game in regular seasons and tourneys.

Using this dataset we can build prediction models with machine learning algorithms in several different levels. For example we can simply use only the seeds difference information to predict the result of tourney games through logistic regression or SVM. It is also possible to build a model for each team based on its historical performance. We will put our effort in some different levels and enrich our experience from this project.

Since the original data locate in several different tables and have inconsistence formats, we will spend some time on data preparation and also initial dataset exploration and visualization. Then we will build a simple model as our baseline and try to enhance it with some different advanced methods.
